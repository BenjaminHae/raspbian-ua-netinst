raspbian-ua-netinst - Raspbian (minimal) unattended netinstaller

This repository will be updated with instructions and more detailed information soon.

You need:

 * a Raspberry Pi Model B
 * working Ethernet with DHCP server
 * no HTTP proxies

The actual image that will be written to a SD card must have only one (small, 50 MB preferred) partition with bootfs/ contents.

The smallest SD card that Raspbian with this installer can fit without any issues is 512 MB.

Actual install process has zero error checking, so if it fails it fails hard.

I take no responsibility for ANY data loss. You will be reflashing your SD card anyway so it should be very clear to you what you are doing.

Some developement ideas that has been suggested:

 * completely configurable eth0 setup from a configuration file in /boot - allows static ips
 * reinstallation support by running the installer again
